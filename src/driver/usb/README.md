## Introduction

XRUSB is a standalone, modern C++ USB protocol stack. It is provided both as a [LibXR](https://github.com/Jiu-xiao/libxr) subtree and as an independent repository. XRUSB focuses on portability, high performance, and easy integration.

## Key Features

* **Modern C++ Implementation**: Written in C++17, using classes and template-based modular encapsulation for easy extension.
* **Lock-Free Data Structures**: All data transfers and event handling are lock-free and thread-safe for maximum efficiency.
* **Double Buffering Mechanism**: Fully utilizes hardware/software double buffers and DMA. Alternating read/write greatly increases data throughput.
* **Dynamic Endpoint Allocation**: Endpoints are allocated on demand during enumeration; multiple classes can automatically manage and reuse endpoints to avoid resource waste.
* **One-Time Memory Allocation**: All memory is determined at compile time and allocated once at construction. No redundant space is reserved for strings/descriptors.
* **Interrupt-Driven**: Operates fully by hardware interrupts, with no reliance on polling or background threads.
* **Interrupt-Safe**: Driver functions can be called directly from ISR (Interrupt Service Routine).
* **Optimized Memory Copy**: Achieves higher throughput for bulk transfers and descriptor processing.

## Device Drivers

This repository only contains platform-independent stack code. For platform-specific device drivers, please refer to the corresponding drivers in libxr, such as `driver/st/stm32_usb_ep.cpp` and `driver/ch/ch32_usb_endpoint_otghs.cpp`.
